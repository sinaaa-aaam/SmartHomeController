# SmartHomeController
The Smart Home Controller is a Java-based application that simulates the control and automation of various smart devices such as lights, alarms, locks, and cameras within a household. To ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability, this project integrates 3 core software design patterns which are the Observer, Factory, Strategy design patterns

##Design Patterns Used and Why
- **Observer Pattern** :The Observer Pattern was chosen to make it easy to differentiate between the states of a device and allow users to monitor the current mode or status of their smart devices. For example, users can see whether the lighting in a room is turned ON or OFF. Whenever a device's state changes, all registered log components are notified immediately, simulating a real-time update on the systemâ€™s interface or logs. Implemented in: UI, Log, and Component interface
- **Factory Pattern** :The Factory Pattern enables the dynamic creation of various smart devices such as lights, alarms, locks, and cameras. This made it easier to scale the system and allowed users to access a broad range of device types from the same interface without hardcoding each one individually. Implemented in: DeviceChoice, Lighting, Cameras, Alarms, Locks
- **Strategy Pattern** : The Strategy Pattern was implemented to support different automation modes, where various sets of behaviors could be applied to groups of devices. For example: Night Mode turns off all devices. Vacation Mode ensures that security devices are ON while others are OFF. Manual Mode turns on all devices manually. This pattern separates automation logic from the core system, improving flexibility and making it easier to add or modify automation behaviors in the future. Implemented in: ControlStrategy, NightMode, VacationMode, ManualControl, AutomationController.
